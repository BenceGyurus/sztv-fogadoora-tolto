Convert the txz file to png.
The first words that starts with upper case will be bold
Double enter is more space on the png
One enter: there is no space on the image, just the line height but the new paragraph will start in new line
separator: the script will make automatically new files but if you want to make new file directly you can use the separator. The separator is --- and all text after this will be puted on a new file. The sepacator can be used more times in the file and the automatically file break will work after the using.
